# PhotoFilterText
I am developing this iOS app to be able to learn the use of OpenCV functions within Swift and be able to perform interesting image processing on the iPhone! Watch this space to stay up-to-date with the developments of this app. Here's the screenshot of what the app looks like right now.

Although the functionality at the moment is minimal, to be able to import OpenCV within Swift is big milestone for my app. GitHub didn't allow me to upload the OpenCV framework as it was over 100MB, you can find the framework here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/ym2kqlfi74x4090/opencv2.framework.zip?dl=0 . Unzip the framework inside 'PhotoFilterText/PhotoFilters/PhotoFilters' folder in order to compile the application and to be able to run it on your iPhone.
